# ical_time_tracker

How to track time spend on different things? 
Use dedicated apps which force you to insert what you actually did even tough you have your schedule known in `ical`?
Don't that seem duplicate?

This assumes, that the "summaries" of the events, i.e., the event names, are tagged by bracket-enclosed tags.
For each tag a timecount is gathered by simply summing corresponding durations.
